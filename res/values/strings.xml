    <string name="description"><b>FixedOrderDialog</b>\nAs far as you probably know there is difference in order of positive and negative buttons for AlertDialog on pre-ICS and post-ICS devices:
\n\t- on devices prior to ICS, the button order (left to right) was POSITIVE - NEUTRAL - NEGATIVE.
\n\t- on newer devices using ICS, the button order (left to right) is now NEGATIVE - NEUTRAL - POSITIVE.
\n
\nHowever the order is not guaranteed to be as listed above for post-ICS devices. Some manufactures ignore button order reversing.
\n
\nIf you want to see one dialog buttons order on all devices no matter of Android firmware version, you can use FixedOrderDialogFragment.</string>
